# üß† Nimbus-Q | Agent Integration Demo

This repo shows how AI agents (like **Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, etc**) can securely access user-uploaded video files via temporary, expiring links ‚Äî without storing data or requiring infra setup.

> **Patent Pending | US Provisional Application Filed (April 2025)**  
> This is a stripped-down demo, not a clone or SDK. It shows how any AI system can interact with the Nimbus-Q flow.

## üîç What This Demo Covers

- `example-agent-call.js` ‚Üí Simulated agent fetch to temp video link
- `sample-response.json` ‚Üí Sample API response format
- `DEMO_LINK.txt` ‚Üí Live product demo: [https://nimbus-q.com/demo](https://nimbus-q.com/demo)

No backend logic, infrastructure, or deletion system is included here ‚Äî just the public-facing usage path.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **User uploads video** via frontend or API
2. **(Optional)** SFW content check runs via base AI model
3. System generates **expiring, encrypted link** for agent access
4. Agent (Grok, GPT, Claude, etc.) fetches video and processes
5. **Auto-deletion** is triggered by agent confirmation or fallback timer

## üëÄ Sample Agent Fetch
```js
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

const TEMP_LINK = 'https://temp-nimbus-link.com/abc123'; // example only

async function runAgent() {
  const response = await fetch(TEMP_LINK);
  const videoBuffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
  console.log('Video fetched. AI can now process it.');
}

runAgent();
